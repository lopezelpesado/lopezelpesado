# Hello and welcome! üëã

I have supported helpful products that people love. I am now learning to be a software developer so that I can create them. I enjoy problem solving and am a tenacious trouble-shooter. I love to learn from and share my knowledge with others.

I started learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript with [Founders and Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/) (FAC) at the beginning of this year and am currently on their [Level 4 Software Developer apprenticeship](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/apprenticeship-guide/) learning full stack web development! üéâ
